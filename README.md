# RenLearnsPython-Again-
A series of short and easy python projects. Each have their own description in the file

I initially learned python when I was in community college. CSULA used JAVA so after learning their curriculum, I forgot most of what Python I knew. These are a series of projects that I have thought up of to demonstrate and practice Python. I learn this on my own time.
